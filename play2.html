      I do entreat your grace to pardon me. I know not by what power I am made <br>
      bold, Nor how it may concern my modesty, In such a presence here to plead <br>
      my thoughts; But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may <br>
      befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

    <p class="speech theseus">
      Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men. <br>
      Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires; Know of your youth, examine <br>
      well your blood, Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, You <br>
      can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, To <br>
      live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold <br>
      fruitless moon. Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood, To undergo <br>
      such maiden pilgrimage; But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd, Than <br>
      that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows, lives and dies in single <br>
      blessedness.
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">HERMIA</h5>
    <p class="speech hermia">
      So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will my virgin patent up <br>
      Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give
      sovereignty.
