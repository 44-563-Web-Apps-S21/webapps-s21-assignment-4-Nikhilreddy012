    <h2>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h2>
    <h4>SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction"><i>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants</i></p>
    <h5 class="name">THESEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech theseus">
      Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace; four happy days <br>
      bring in Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes! she <br>
      lingers my desires, Like to a step-dame or a dowager Long withering out a <br>
      young man revenue.
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">HIPPOLYTA</h5>
    <p class="speech hippolyta">
      Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; Four nights will quickly <br>
      dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in <br>
      heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">THESEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech theseus">
      Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert <br>
      and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals; The pale <br>
      companion is not for our pomp. 
    </p>
    <p class="stage-direction"><i>Exit PHILOSTRATE</i></p>
    <p class="speech theseus">
      Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love, doing thee <br>
      injuries; But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph and <br>
      with revelling.
    </p>
    <p class="stage-direction"><i>Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS</i></p>
    <h5 class="name">EGEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech egeus">Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</p>
    <h5 class="name">THESEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech theseus">Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?</p>
    <h5 class="name">EGEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech egeus">
      Full of vexation come I, with complaint Against my child, my daughter <br>
      Hermia. Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, This man hath my consent to <br>
      marry her. Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke, This man hath <br>
      bewitch'd the bosom of my child; Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her <br>
      rhymes, And interchanged love-tokens with my child: Thou hast by moonlight <br>
      at her window sung, With feigning voice verses of feigning love, And <br>
      stolen the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, <br>
      gawds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers Of <br>
      strong prevailment in unharden'd youth: With cunning hast thou filch'd my <br>
      daughter's heart, Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, To stubborn <br>
      harshness: and, my gracious duke, Be it so she; will not here before your <br>
      grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of <br>
      Athens, As she is mine, I may dispose of her: Which shall be either to <br>
      this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Immediately provided <br>
      in that case.
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">THESEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech theseus">
      What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid: To you your father should be <br>
      as a god; One that composed your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are <br>
      but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the <br>
      figure or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">HERMIA</h5>
    <p class="speech hermia">So is Lysander.</p>
    <h5 class="name">THESEUS</h5>
    <p class="speech theseus">
      In himself he is; But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other <br>
      must be held the worthier.
    </p>
    <h5 class="name">HERMIA</h5>
    <p class="speech hermia">I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</p>
